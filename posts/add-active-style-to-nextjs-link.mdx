I needed to figure out how to create an active state for any of my menu items that were active. Different CSS would be applied. I was transferring a design from Gatsby.js over to Next.js. Gatsby has this built-in. Whereas in Next.js I had to search around.

## Gatsby active state with native Link Component

Gatsby implements active state like so:

```jsx
<Link
  // activeStyle={}
  activeClassName='active' // style in your CSS
  to={`${link.url}`}
>
  {link.label}
</Link>
```

Gatsby has two arguements. One if you're using something like Styled-Components. You can but the style object in the `activeStyle` prop above. Otherwise, you can use the `activeClassName` prop and put a class name as a string. This is for using a global stylesheet or css modules. Your can find more information on this in the [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/#link-api-surface-area)

Unfortunately, these options are not built into Next.js.

## Solving active state for links in Next.js

This is very possible to do use the `useRouter()` function from next.js.

```js
import Link from 'next/link';

import { HamburgerMenuIcon } from '../icons.js';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import styles from './menu.module.css';

// function which we will import into our main component. Can be it's own component.
function MenuLinkItems() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const activeRoute = router.pathname; // find out which url we are at.

  // these can of course be imported from another source
  const menuLinks = [
    { id: 1, urlPath: './', label: 'Home' },
    { id: 2, urlPath: './blog', label: 'Blog' },
    { id: 3, urlPath: './contact', label: 'Contact' },
  ];

  return (
    <ul className='menu'>
      {menuLinks.map((link) => (
        <li key={link.id}>
          // If you're curious, otherwise delete these console.log()s.
          {console.log(`.${activeRoute}`, '<-- active')}
          {console.log(link.urlPath, '<-- link')}
          <Link href={link.urlPath} passHref>
            <a
              className={
                `.${activeRoute}` === link.urlPath ? styles.active : ''
              }
            >
              {link.label}
            </a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function Menu() {
  return (
    <div className='main-menu'>
      <label
        htmlFor='nav-toggle'
        aria-haspopup='true'
        aria-controls='nav-toggle'
        className='nav-toggle-label'
      >
        <HamburgerMenuIcon size='35' />
      </label>

      <input
        type='checkbox'
        id='nav-toggle'
        className='nav-toggle'
        name='nav-toggle'
        aria-label='nav-toggle'
      />

      <nav id='mainmenulabel' role='navigation' aria-label='Main menu'>
        <MenuLinkItems /> // import component here.
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Menu;
```

I did get an `warning`, but there was no way around getting it. If you find a solution that doesn't get this warning, please let me know.

```bash
next-dev.js?3515:20 Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?

Check the render method of `ForwardRef(LinkComponent)`.
```
