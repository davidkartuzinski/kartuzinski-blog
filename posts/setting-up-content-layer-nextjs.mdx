## Contentlayer

Contentlayer helps with your MDX files so you have less code.

## What I am building

I am building a blog like (Gatsby Theme Naked)[https://gatsythemenakedcore.gtsb.io/]. I built this theme for Gatsby, but I want to recreate it for Next.js and then go from there. The part that is related to Contentlayer is the .mdx files. And specifically the frontmatter.

In the theme, I build my frontmatter like this:

```
title: 'Markdown Cheatsheet in MDX and Gatsby'
slug: 'markdown-cheatsheet-mdx-gatsby'
date: 2020-02-18
dateModified: 2020-02-18
author: 'David Kartuzinski'
description: 'See how well Markdown is supported use MDX and Gatsby. Compared to the Markdown Cheatsheet.'
categories: ['markdown', 'mdx', 'gatsby']
tags: ['mdx', 'editor', 'markdown']
hero_image: './markdown.png'
hero_image_alt: 'Markdown Logo'
canonical: ''
```

I will start with implementing the following:

- title
- date
- dateModified
- author
- description
- Hero Image
- Hero Image Alt
- Canonical
  The `slug` is not needed as we will automatically create the slugs from the folder names. The `tags` and `categories` we'll add later.

## Implementing Contentlayer in a brand new Next.js install

The Contentlayer documentation and [delba.dev](https://delba.dev/blog/next-blog-structured-mdx-content-with-contentlayer) have their examples in `.ts` format. I will be using `.js` as I haven't learned TypeScript, and I believe there will be people who would like a `.js` version.

### Install the needed `npm` dependencies

In your command line terminal, you will need to install `contentlayer` and `next-contentlayer`.

```bash title='Terminal'
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer
```

1. In your `root` directory, edit (or create) a `next.config.js` file. In it, you should have the following:

```js title='next-config.js'
const { withContentlayer } = require('next-contentlayer');

const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```

2. In your `root` directory, create a `jsconfig.json` file. This file is very often used for those individuals who program in TypeScript. However, the [NextJs Docs about jsconfig.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) make it clear that this is the file used for creating path aliases. Which means, telling `NextJs` how to access certain files and in what directories. Contentlayer needs to be configured in this file, like below:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "contentlayer/generated": ["./.contentlayer/generated"]
    }
  },
  "include": [".contentlayer/generated"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

3. In your `root` directory, create a `contentlayer.config.js` file. This file is the main configuration file that makes Contentlayer so magical. We will come back to it a few times, as we build out the blog. **Note:** You can read more about this section in the [Contentlayer Documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/sources/files/mapping-document-types).

a. Start off your `contentlayer.config.js` with the following content. (We are missing the `Tags` and `Categories`. You may want to add additional or less fields.)

```js
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files';

const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  contentType: 'mdx',
  // Location of Post source files (relative to `contentDirPath`)
  filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The title of the post',
      required: true,
    },
    date: {
      type: 'date',
      description: 'The create date of the post',
      required: true,
    },
    dateModified: {
      type: 'date',
      description: 'The last updated date of the post',
      required: true, // mandatory so just use the created date until modified later.
    },
    author: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The author of the post',
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: 'string',
      description:
        'The excerpt or description of the post to show as a snippet.',
      required: true,
    },
    hero_image: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The main blog post hero image.',
      required: true,
    },
    hero_image_alt: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The alt-text for the hero image for the blog post.',
      required: true,
    },
    canonical: {
      type: 'string',
      description:
        'If this is a copy or duplicate of another post, what is that URL',
      required: false,
    },
  },
  computedFields: {
    slug: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (post) => `/blog/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`,
    },
  },
}));

export default makeSource({
  // location of the source files
  contentDirPath: 'posts',
  documentTypes: [Post],
});
```

4. Add `.contentlayer` to your `.gitignore` file. You probably don't want the generated json as part of your GitHub. Vercel, or wherever your hosting it, will get it.

To the bottom of your `.gitignore` file.

```bash
#contentlater
.contentlayer
```

npm install date-fns
